# LITA_CapstoneProject_SalesData

### Project Objective
This project aims to analyze the sales performance of a retail store by exploring available data to ascertain top-selling products, regional performance, and monthly sales trends. This will, in turn, inform our decision about which products to improve upon and the ones to cut down on. 

### Data Sources
The primary source for the data used here is SalesData.csv from the LITA Capstone Project.
